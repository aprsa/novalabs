   - "Start Here" label

2. **Solar System (Center)**
   - 🔴 Mars (red planet with shadows)
   - 🟠 Jupiter (orange with storm bands)
   - 🪐 Saturn (with iconic rings)
   - Floating animation (orbital motion)

3. **Deep Space (Top Right)**
   - 🌌 Spiral galaxy with purple/blue glow
   - Rotating animation
   - "Advanced Labs" destination

## Lab Nodes

### Visual States

Each lab is represented as a circular node with distinct styling:

1. **Locked (🔒)**
   - Gray gradient background
   - Disabled cursor
   - Lock icon
   - Dimmed appearance

2. **Unlocked (🔓)**
   - Golden yellow gradient
   - Pulsing glow animation
   - Unlock icon
   - Highly visible

3. **In Progress (▶)**
   - Blue gradient
   - Play icon
   - Active appearance

4. **Completed (✓)**
   - Green gradient
   - Checkmark icon
   - Success state

### Interactive Features

- **Hover Effect**: Scales up 1.2x with enhanced glow
- **Click Action**: Opens detailed lab dialog
- **Path Connections**: Dotted lines connect sequential labs
- **Active Paths**: Completed labs have glowing animated paths

## Lab Positioning

Labs are positioned along a curved path:

- **0-33%**: Earth to inner solar system (steep upward curve)
- **33-66%**: Inner to outer solar system (gradual rise)
- **66-100%**: Outer solar system to deep space (final ascent)

## Information Panel

Bottom-center panel with:

### Progress Overview

- Current rank (with golden badge)
- Total score
- Bonus points earned

### Lab Status

- ✓ Completed count
- ▶ In progress count
- 🔓 Available count
- Total labs

### Legend

- Color-coded status indicators
- Visual reference for lab states

## Lab Detail Dialog

When clicking a lab node:

### Information Displayed

- Lab name (large heading)
- Description
- Current status (color-coded)
- Score (if completed/in progress)
- Bonus points (if earned)
- Prerequisites list
- Category badge

### Actions

- **Close**: Dismiss dialog
- **Start Lab**: For unlocked labs
- **Launch Lab**: For in-progress/completed labs (opens in new window)

## Header Bar

Top navigation with:

- NovaLabs branding
- "Cosmic Journey" subtitle
- User name
- Rank badge (glowing golden style)
- "Dashboard" button (return to classic view)
- Logout button

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Animations

- `@keyframes twinkle`: Star twinkling effect (10s)
- `@keyframes rotate`: Planet/galaxy rotation (15-30s)
- `@keyframes pulse`: Unlocked lab pulsing (2s)
- `@keyframes flow`: Path animation (2s)
- `@keyframes orbit`: Planet floating motion (15s)

### SVG Path System

- Dynamic path generation based on lab count
- Quadratic bezier curves for smooth connections
- Conditional styling (active vs inactive)
- Responsive to viewport size

### Responsive Layout

- SVG viewBox: 1920x1080 (scales to any size)
- Absolute positioning with percentage-based coordinates
- Z-index layering for depth

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback

- Notifications for actions (start lab, errors)
- Tooltips showing lab names
- Status icons in nodes
- Color-coded progress indicators

### Navigation Flow

1. User logs in
2. Views cosmic journey
3. Identifies available labs (glowing gold)
4. Clicks to see details
5. Starts or launches labs
6. Watches progress along cosmic path

### Accessibility

- Clear visual states
- Descriptive labels
- Error messages
- Logical tab flow
